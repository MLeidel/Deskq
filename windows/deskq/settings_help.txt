Coedit SETTINGS:

The "settings" file is stored in:
	/home/$USER/.config (Linux)
	AppDirectory (Windows)
	

Use the "Settings" option on the File menu.

You need not edit the 1st line as that is the geometry
and will be updated by just moving and resizing
the window.

Options are:
1. geometry
2. font name
3. font size
4. background color
5. foreground color

Change any of items 2 - 5 and then
save (Ctrl-s or using the menu).

Do not do a Save-As.
